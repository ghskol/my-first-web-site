It is primarily used in web browsers , and has the ability to access built-in objects of other applications. It is also used for server programming, such as runtime environments such as Node.js.

  <p>Although JavaScript shares some similarities with Sun Microsystems' Java in terms of syntax, this is because both languages ​​are based on the basic syntax of the C language, and Java and JavaScript have little direct connection . Aside from the name and syntax, it has more similarities with Self and Scheme than with Java.</p>
