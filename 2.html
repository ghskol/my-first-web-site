<h2>CSS</h2>
<p><strong><a href="https://ko.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS" target="_blank" title="CSS specification">Cascading Style Sheets ( CSS )</a></strong> are a style language that describes how a markup language is actually displayed. They are mainly used in HTML and XHTML, and can also be used in XML . They are a W3C standard and offer a high degree of freedom in defining layout and styles . The default file name is style.css.</p>

<p>If markup language (e.g. HTML ) is in charge of the body of a website , CSS is in charge of decorating it like clothes and accessories. In other words, you can make it look like a completely different website by leaving the HTML structure as is and only changing the CSS file .</p>
